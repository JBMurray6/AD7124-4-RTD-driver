# AD7124-4-RTD-driver
Schematic and board for driving a set of 4 RTDs in series. Designed for precision differential temperature measurements.

Designed to drive up to 4 devices with series current and with a ratiometric measurement scheme. The Ref resistors (two are added for flexibility but only one is actually required) give a known voltage drop to which the voltage drops of the other devices is compared. A good overview of this system can be found here: http://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/afe-design-considerations-rtd-ratiometric.html
